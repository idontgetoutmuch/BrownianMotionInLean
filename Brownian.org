The basic idea of $L^2$ constructions of Brownian motions is as
follows. Let $\{\xi_k\}$ be a sequence of iid Gaussian random
variables. Let $\{\phi_k\}$ be a complete orthonormal basis system in
$L^2([0,1])$. The idea is to show that the limit

$$
\lim_{N\to \infty} B^N(t)
$$

is a Brownian motion, where

$$
B^N(t) = \sum^N_{k=1} \xi_k \, \langle \mathbb{1}_{[0,t]}, \phi_k \rangle.
$$

It can be shown that the aximos of the Brownian motions always hold
**except for the continuity axiom**. In literature, in order to prove
the continuity axiom, one has to spefically choose the basis
$\{\phi_k\}$, for example, the Haar and Schauder basis.

haar :: forall n k .
        (KnownNat n, KnownNat k, (2 * k - 1 <=? 2^n - 1) ~ 'True) =>
        Haar n (2 * k - 1)
haar = Haar g where
  g t | (k' - 1) * 2 ** (-n') < t && t <= k'       * 2 ** (-n') =  2 ** ((n' - 1) / 2)
      | k'       * 2 ** (-n') < t && t <= (k' + 1) * 2 ** (-n') = -2 ** ((n' - 1) / 2)
      | otherwise                                               =  0
    where
        n' = fromIntegral (natVal (Proxy :: Proxy n))
        k' = 2 * (fromIntegral (natVal (Proxy :: Proxy k))) - 1
